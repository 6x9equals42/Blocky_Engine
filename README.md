# Blocky_Engine

A tile-based game ~~engine~~ written using SFML.

### About

This is no longer really an engine, and more a singular game.

For now, Blocky_Engine is intended to be a puzzle game. Players can select levels (of which only a few are written), and play the levels. The world has a small set of mechanics which I hope are fairly intuitive. The goal of the game is to grow all the trees. Controls are arrow keys, R (restart) and Z (undo).

Editing mode can currently be accessed from the menu (not advised) or by pressing Enter from any level (slightly more advised). Then the mouse selects tiles and there are ~20 badly chosen keyboard inputs that make various changes to the level.

Currently contains support for animations, but does not actually have any. The current showcase of my artistic ability is bad enough. All textures were carefully crafted using MSPaint.

### Installing

If you want to install this project, or use it in your choice of other IDEs, I've included a CMakeLists.txt alongside the VS files. To generate properly, you need to have SFML installed, and if it's in an unusual location (or you're on Windows), you may have to set SFML_ROOT in your system vars.

### Screenshots

Well I wasn't going to include this but ... oh well. Maybe I'll spend time on better artwork in the future.
